This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Read in Bureau of Transport Statistics dataset from

```{r}
#Pipeline the data into Rstudio

#Get data from AWS to local copy of rstudio
#Source: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/running-r-on-aws/

#library("RCurl") 
#data <- read.table(getURL("https://ec2-54-237-132-222.compute-1.amazonaws.com/Data/On_Time_Performance_2018.csv"), sep=",", #header=FALSE)
#head(data)

```

```{r}

#read in the raw dataset
airports <- read.csv("C:/Users/Luciana/CEBD1261/CEBD1261_Project/Data/On_Time_Performance_2018.csv", header = TRUE)

# view summary for unusual data values

```

#
# Clean the dataset to exclude null values and time format that do not conform to standard, then add variable
# to break time point into 15 min interval timepoint.
#
```{r}
# Remove the rows by checking if not (!) an NA due to not meeting the date format
temp<- airports[!is.na(strptime(airports$DepTime, format = "%H%M")),]

class(temp$DepTime)

#Split time series data into time intervals by every 15 minutes and then plot the count

# Extract time value from variable and make dataframes used for graphs and summary table

#
# 1. Big Data Example
# ===================================
# Make dataframes used for graphs and summary table
#
```{r}

# based on variable values
ds1 <- myDF[ which(myDF$DayofMonth == 1 & myDF$OriginState=="NY"), ]

ds1[with(ds1, order(Time)), ]

```

#
# Plot the data using ggplot2 and pipes
#
```{r}

# Prepare dataset and pipe the dataset into the graph
graph1 <- ds1 %>%
ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Origin, group=OriginStateName, color = Carrier)) +
      geom_point() +  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c("00:00", "11:00", "12:00", "14:00","16:00","18:00", "20:00","23:00")  ) 
      labs(title = "New York State Airport Departures by Time Intervals",
           subtitle = "*The data frame is sent to the plot using pipes",
           y = "Airport Origin code",
           x = "Departure Time") + theme_bw(base_size = 8) +
      theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())

#printout graph #1
graph1

```
# 
# Turn the gplot into an interactive chart. 
#
```{r}

ggplotly(graph1)

```

# 2. Sampling and BI Summary Example
# ===================================
# Count Distribution by State and Origin City of Airport Departures by Carrier
#


```{r}

# Create dataset with overall count distributions

ds2 <- myDF[ which(myDF$Carrier %in% c("9E","AA","AS","B6","DL","EV","F9")), ]

dfr_prop <- ds2 %>% 
  count(OriginState, Carrier) %>%  # group_by() & summarise(n=n()) are implicit
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n))     # prop = n/sum(n) works too /  prop.table(n)

as.data.frame(dfr_prop)            # print df

```

```{r}
#Plot distribution percentage summary for month of January

gg_prop <- ggplot(data = data.frame()
                  , aes(x =OriginState, y = prop, fill = Carrier)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', position = 'stack', alpha = 2/3) +  
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +  
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c("AK", "CA","FL", "IL", "GA","LA","MI","MO","NC","OH", "NJ","NY","PA","TX","WY")  ) +
  scale_fill_few('medium', drop = FALSE) +            # keep levels, if data is filtered
  labs(x = 'State', y = NULL, fill = 'Carrier',
       title = 'Distribution of Flights by State and Carrier for Month of January')  # title of graph

gg_prop %+%   dfr_prop  

```

#
# End of program.
