### R Program ###
---
The R program code is named "CEBD1261_Project.Rmd" and its results may be viewed in the same named file with the extension html.


#### Use Case 1: An interactive chart in R to visualize the data for flight information ###
---
This chart plots departure times for a state for all airports in a period of time.  The axis is adjustable for another time period.  When hovering over the points, information about the flight is set in a popup-box.


#### Use Case 2: Count Distribution by State and Origin City of Airport Departures by Carrier ###
---
This is a descriptive analysis of the percentage proportion of flights per airline for every state in the United States. The data summary was prepared in a R data frame before plotting the variables. 

### Summary ###

The use case #1 graph is an interactive plot of departure flights for all airports in a particular state.  The x-axis is moveable for selecting a different time period.

The use case #2 graph summarizes the proportion of flights for each airline in all airports in all states. This graph shows the biggest users of the airports in a state.
